# Simple Planning Workflow for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Documentation-Driven Development

### Core Documents
- **plan.md**: Main task tracking and development phases
- **research.md**: Solution exploration and technical references
- **ideas.md**: Abstract concepts and design exploration
- **scratch_history.md**: Failed approaches and lessons learned

### Document Usage
1. **Before starting:** Check ideas.md for design decisions
2. **When stuck:** Consult research.md for solutions
3. **During work:** Update plan.md task status
4. **After failures:** Document in scratch_history.md

## Task Management: plan.md-Driven

### Plan Tracking
- `- [ ]` = Pending
- `- [‚ö†Ô∏è]` = In Progress  
- `- [üî¨]` = Researching (see research.md)
- `- [x]` = Completed
- Add notes below tasks for decisions/blockers
- Reference other docs when relevant: `(see research.md#section)`

### Daily Workflow
1. **Check docs:** Review plan.md priorities, ideas.md for context
2. **Pick task:** Select highest priority uncompleted item
3. **Mark status:** `- [‚ö†Ô∏è]` or `- [üî¨]` if researching
4. **Research if needed:** Update research.md with findings
5. **Implement:** Code following task requirements
6. **Test:** Verify implementation
7. **Commit:** Concise message <50 chars, no emojis
8. **Mark complete:** `- [x] Task name`
9. **Document:** Update relevant docs (plan/research/scratch)

## Git Standards

### Commits
```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement user auth"
# Use: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:
# Keep under 50 characters, no emojis
# Reference tasks only when critical for context
```

### Branch Strategy
- Feature branches for multi-step tasks: `feature/short-description`
- Direct commits to main for small fixes and docs
- Keep commits ATOMIC and FOCUSED
- Test before merging to main

## Code Quality

### Python Projects (Pre-commit Setup): We have a specific pre-commit hook for Python projects.
```bash
cp templates/config/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Runs ruff check/format on staged Python files only
```

### Standards
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Add type hints and minimal docstrings
- Test core functionality (no mocks preferred)
- Keep functions focused and simple
- Document complex logic in research.md

### File Organization
```
{{PROJECT_NAME}}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/{{PROJECT_NAME}}/     # Source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                    # Test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                     # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plan.md                   # Task tracking and phases
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research.md               # Technical solutions and references
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ideas.md                  # Design decisions and concepts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scratch_history.md        # Failed attempts and lessons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml           # Project config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Project overview
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore               # Include: plan.md, *.md (except README)
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### plan.md Updates
- Track task status in real-time
- Add implementation notes below tasks
- Reference other docs: `(see research.md#api-design)`
- Keep phases organized and current

### research.md Structure
```markdown
# Research Notes

## Problem: [Brief description]
### Explored Solutions:
1. **Approach A**: [Details, pros/cons]
2. **Approach B**: [Details, pros/cons]
### Decision: [What was chosen and why]
### References: [Links, docs, examples]
```

### ideas.md Format
```markdown
# Design Ideas

## Feature: [Name]
### Concept: [High-level description]
### Rationale: [Why this approach]
### Considerations: [Trade-offs, alternatives]
```

### scratch_history.md Purpose
```markdown
# Failed Attempts Log

## Attempt: [What was tried]
### Date: [When]
### Issue: [What went wrong]
### Lesson: [What was learned]
### Alternative: [What worked instead]
```

### PR Process
- Create descriptive PR titles (no task IDs)
- Reference relevant documentation in PR body
- Update all docs (plan/research/ideas) when merged
- Include test results and validation
