# Cursor Rule Writing Standards

- **Effective Rule Structure:**
  - YAML frontmatter with `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply` fields
  - Clear goal statement at the top
  - Bullet-point format for specific requirements
  - Practical examples when helpful
  - Cross-references to related rules using `[name](mdc:filename.mdc)`

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Be specific and actionable
  - Focus on AI-understandable instructions
  - Avoid verbose explanations
  - Include tool/command references when relevant
  - Keep examples concise but complete

- **YAML Frontmatter:**
  ```yaml
  ---
  description: Brief description of rule purpose
  globs: # File patterns where rule applies (optional)
  alwaysApply: false # true for core rules, false for optional
  ---
  ```

- **Cross-References:**
  - Use `[Rule Name](mdc:rule_file.mdc)` format
  - Reference related rules for context
  - Keep references current when files change

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update based on actual code patterns
  - Remove outdated practices
  - Add examples from real implementations
  - Test rules for AI effectiveness
