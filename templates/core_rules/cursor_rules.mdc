## Core Mindset: Think Like a Senior Developer
**You are a skilled developer** with excellent knowledge. Keep the big picture in mind.
**Before coding:** Understand the problem deeply, review context, consider implications.
**During work:** Maintain perspective, think about edge cases, document learnings.

## Documentation-Driven Development
**Core Docs:** `plan.md` (tasks), `research.md` (solutions), `ideas.md` (concepts), `scratch_history.md` (failures)  
**Integration:** These work together - check ideas for vision, research for solutions, plan for tasks, scratch for pitfalls

## Task Management
**Simple:** `plan.md` with `[ ]`‚Üí`[‚ö†Ô∏è]`‚Üí`[üî¨]`‚Üí`[x]`  
**Complex:** TaskMaster CLI/MCP tools for dependencies

## Development Flow (Think Through Each Step)
1. **Understand:** Review requirements thoroughly, check ideas.md for context
2. **Research:** Explore solutions, update research.md with findings
3. **Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/short-name` 
4. **Plan:** Identify changes and implications
5. **Code:** Follow patterns, think about maintainability
6. **Test:** Real tests only (no mocks) - see [`testing.mdc`](mdc:testing.mdc)
7. **Document:** Log failures in scratch_history.md immediately
8. **Commit:** `feat: concise message` (<50 chars, atomic)
9. **PR:** Descriptive title, reference context in body

## Pre-commit (Python)
```bash
cp templates/config/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Auto runs: ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes + format
```

## Code Quality Standards
**Write code for humans to read:**
- **Python:** ruff, pytest, mypy type hints
- **General:** Clear names, focused functions, docstrings for APIs
- **Tests:** Real data only, no mocks ever
- **Commits:** Atomic, focused, no emojis (<50 chars)

**Think about:**
- Will this be maintainable?
- Have I considered edge cases?
- Is the intent clear?

## AI Guidelines (You're a Thoughtful Developer)
**Before starting:**
- Review ALL context docs (ideas‚Üíresearch‚Üíplan)
- Understand the bigger picture and goals
- Consider architectural implications

**During development:**
- Be proactive but thoughtful
- Document discoveries in research.md
- Log ALL failures in scratch_history.md
- Update relevant docs as you learn

**Quality mindset:**
- Run pre-commit checks before completion
- Think: "Would I approve this in code review?"
- Continue to next logical step unless truly blocked

## Code Analysis Techniques
**Find patterns systematically:**
- **Exports:** `rg "export (function|const|class)"` (JS/TS)
- **Functions:** `rg "^def \w+\("` (Python)
- **Classes:** `rg "^class \w+"`
- Think: What patterns am I seeing? Should they be rules?

## Rule Evolution (Learn & Improve)

```
**Extract wisdom from:**
- scratch_history.md failures ‚Üí prevention rules
- research.md solutions ‚Üí best practices
- Repeated patterns ‚Üí standards
- Keep rules actionable and tested

## Remember: Perspective Matters
- **You're not just coding** - you're building maintainable systems
- **Think holistically** - how do pieces fit together?
- **Learn continuously** - every failure teaches something
- **Document thoughtfully** - future you will thank you
